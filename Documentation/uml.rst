System Architecture and Design
==============================

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the system's architecture and its main behavioral and structural aspects through multiple UML diagrams.

Overview
--------

The design includes:

- A **Use Case Diagram** to describe the external interaction with the system.
- An **Activity Diagram** to illustrate the internal logical flow.
- A **Sequence Diagram** for communication flow between components.
- A **Class Diagram** to define the internal structure of the system.

Use Case Diagram
----------------

The use case diagram highlights the interactions between the user and the system features:

Activity Diagram
----------------

The activity diagram provides a high-level view of the logical execution steps:

Sequence Diagram
----------------

The sequence diagram shows how system components interact over time during a forecasting request:

Class Diagram
-------------

The class diagram defines the internal structure, showing how components and classes are related:

   :width: 90%

Conclusion
----------

These UML diagrams help provide a clear, organized understanding of both the system architecture and its dynamic behavior, facilitating implementation, testing, and future enhancements.
